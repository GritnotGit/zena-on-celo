#### Project Description
Finacial and Technical education does not exist sufficiently in German schools.
The Web3 space can bring financial as well as technological topics to the table.
This is why the idea for ZENA came up.

ZENA is a web3 online/mobile-first education and onboarding tool for (German) teenagers that reduces the complexity of web3 concepts and enables them to build open source collaborative problem solving tools for their future.

During Celo's hackathon, we want to leverage the project to a new level and focus on ReFi and regenerative token engineering education and empowerment. The ReFi learning chapter will include a theoretical introduction to ReFi concepts and a hands-on learning session, which is completely embedded in a safe space without handling a "real" wallet and coins, backed by Alfajores testnet. 

Our project aims to help (German) teenagers to close this knowledge gap by introducing web3 concepts and visions in a complexity reducing, hands on and gamified way. We want to encourage teachers and parents to use this modular tool in collaboration with their pupils and their own kids.
