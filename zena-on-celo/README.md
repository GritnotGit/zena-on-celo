#### Project Description

ZENA is a climate positive Web3 building block for young teenagers and educators based on a LEARN to IMPACT concept that enables them to combine learning with climate action in a complexity reducing, hands on, mobile first and gamified fun way.

ZENA wants to support young people in taking responsibility for themselves, for others, and for the world by providing infrastructure that connects web3 with environmental impact and social impact markets -the education sector- outside of crypto. 

We’re aiming to invite initiatives and companies to act as funders for our gaming-like concept, so we’re able to gather tokenized carbon credits like BCT upfront and can incentivize youths to learn and improve their knowledge for real-world impact rather than just levels, points, and high scores.


#### Summary
During the Celo hackathon we have implemented an open source infrastructure called The Toucan Bridge into ZENA that connects the voluntary carbon market to Web3 by bringing carbon credits on-chain in a tokenized form. By completing learning chapters and quests the young user of ZENA mobile dApp will earn impact NFTs, sequestering tokenized carbon credits. 

For now the NFT is only holding the carbon credit. Which doesn't really offset it, but it does lower supply which results in higher price and gets more people involved, which leads to less CO2 in the air. Later it will also be possible to retire carbon and to earn and retire a number of other eco credits. 

Connecting web3 with climate resilience is more than just futuristic technology it is also about how young people can find their place in the world against barriers and uncertainties. That’s what we are building ZENA for.
